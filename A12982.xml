            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

My apologie is at hand, my defence not farre to ſeeke.</p>
            <p>The caſe is not alike, and ſo our courſe may well differ; for with them the danger was well ouer, <hi>Dauids</hi> wrath was well appeaſed, ſo that ſhee might with ſafetie watch a fitter opportunitie, to communicate thoſe things vnto

            <p>Skilfull Phyſitians haue their time of the yeere, of the Moone, and of the ſigne, which they hold beſt and fitteſt for letting of blood, cutting, ſearing, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring of purging potions; yet if they ſee the ſtate of the ſicke pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cannot well abide ſo long vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealt with, but in ſome diſeaſes it be dangerous to delay a day, nay but a few houres, (as in a plureſie) they wil open a veine, though the ſigne be in the vitall parts, which in their generall practiſe they hold vnfit, and often ioyned with great danger: neither doe men vſuallie reprooue them for it, vnleſſe it be out of their ignorance. Can I then of any man be iuſtly blamed, if I
<pb facs="tcp:6506:4"/> offer this ſpirituall Phyſicke to all, and be S. <hi>Pauls</hi> preacher <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.2.</note> 
               <hi>Out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> euen now as it were to let the ſicke blood, when the ſigne is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie nie the heart? Seeing if wee had no particular occaſion, by Gods iudgements, yet the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall condition of all, who are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and the generall infection of all, who are ſinfull, and the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſitie of this dutie, which being not taken in hand in time, but deferred a day, nay an houre or two, may as much danger the ſpirituall eſtate of the ſoule, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of bleeding in a plureſie, may the health of the bodie. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture ſpeaketh but of one time or day, of turning vnto God, which time and tide being not taken, there is no turning of the tide againe, no reuolution of the time, but that though a man may liue with <hi>Eſau</hi> many a yeere after he hath loſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opportunitie of the bleſſing, and of repentance, to ſeeke it, and that with a
<pb facs="tcp:6506:5"/> fountaine of teares, <note place="margin">Heb. 12.17.</note> 
               <hi>Yet hee may not find place to repentance.</hi> It cannot then vpon the point bee vnſeaſonable, for me to cal for this in euery ſeaſon; which at no time can come too ſoone, nor yet too late, ſo it be ſerious, and true: but the occaſion being let ſlip, cannot be recouered againe, if a man would giue a world for it. Beſides, I am not without preſident of the like. For the holy man <hi>Iob,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iob 1.5.</note> called, and commanded his ſonnes to ſacrifice, and ſo to repent (for thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the burnt offerings hee made, led them) not at the end of their feaſts, when their ſeuen daies were ouer, but euery day, leſt that ſhould fall out which hee feared, that they ſhould ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, though it were but in their hearts, (ſo carefull was he) a thing eaſily ſeaſing vpon the hart, hands, and tongue, when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell fleſh is pampered with full diet, and many diſhes, and the mind with pleaſures and delites
<pb facs="tcp:6506:5"/> tranſported out of it ſelfe; yea and fearing alſo, that which after fell out, leſt if they deferred their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſeeking of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, they might be ouertaken with death in the very act of their feaſting, <note place="margin">Verſ. 18.19.</note> as they afterward were, when they began their courſes of feaſting, euen in the firſt day. Hath not that alſo ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with this, <note place="margin">Iohn 19.41.</note> that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> built his ſepulchre in the place of his pleaſure, his garden, as knowing how eaſie it was for him in his pleaſures to forget himſelfe, and his end? And if we be men of the ſame matter, and caſt in the ſame mould, yet their holines excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ours, this doctrine of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, may not be vnfit for vs, not onely to be known but practiſed, leſt if wee deferre it, it ſhould fall out with ſome of vs (as it may wel with all) for any Writ of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge wee can ſue out, that wee may with <hi>Iobs</hi> ſonnes, bee taken before our feaſts be ouer, and ere
<pb facs="tcp:6506:6"/> euer the time of feaſting come.</p>
            <p>If this ſeaſon be vnfit, becauſe the time is our feaſt, yet being the doctrine of mortification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation, of putting off the old man, and putting on the new, of making <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.17.</note> 
               <hi>men new creatures in Christ Ieſus, when old things are paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and all things are become new;</hi> I ſuppoſe it to haue a ſpeciall fitnes for the time.</p>
            <p>Now this I offer to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, to continue the ſignification of my dutie, begun in the former, as by a freewill offering, when the other was enioined by your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſo could not ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intimate my dutie. Yet in this I reſpect not dutie only, but deſire of your Lordſhips ſpirituall, and eternall honor, which muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by walking this way, or els there is no way to compaſſe it.</p>
            <p>I vndertooke to handle this point publikely, at the requeſt of diuers of my auditorie, who had often heard me preſſe the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:6506:6"/> of it, and yet not ſo diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conceiuing the nature of the thing, deſired I would diuert my ordinary courſe of preaching, and handle this point at the full, and in all the particulars.</p>
            <p>I now haue written it by others importunitie, who deſired it for a more publike good, and offer it firſt vnto your Honour, which I deſire might haue not the leaſt, but the beſt part, and profit in it, and by it.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe your Honour to heare thus much from mee, that this dutie belongs to honourable Perſonages, men of your place, as well as to the pooreſt peſants, as the precepts of the ſcriptures, and the practiſe of King <hi>Dauid; Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Manaſſes,</hi> and others doe proue. The reaſon of which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now though there be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of men, as there is of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, while the Merchants account laſteth, ſome ſtanding for pence, ſome for pounds, ſome for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
<pb facs="tcp:6506:7"/> and thouſands: and as of plaiers while they are vpon the ſtage, ſome going for rich, ſome for poore, ſome for knights, ſome for kings while the play continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and as of trees in the forreſt, ſome are oakes, ſome elmes, ſome poplers, ſome thornes, ſome briers and brambles, while they ſtand growing: yet when the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is ended, when the play is finiſhed, when the trees are cut downe, ſpecially burnt to aſhes, there will bee no difference at all.

               <hi>As if a man did flie from a Lion, and a Beare met him: or went into the houſe, and leaned his hand on the wall, and the ſerpent bit him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Prophets and Saints of God, haue a contrarie preſeruatiue, not againſt this plague only, but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either to keepe themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched of them, or at leaſt to turne them to their good. And this they call not flying, but returning; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of this are two, laide downe euery where in the Scripture; <hi>Ceaſe to doe euill, learne to do well, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew euill and doe good.</hi> Yea this is both a reſtoratiue and a preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, by which men may remoue the preſent, and preuent greater iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to come.</p>
            <p>Now for the inſtructing of you in the nature, and for the directing of you, in the vſe and practiſe of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine and duty, at the requeſt of ſome of you, I laboured in publike to deliuer
<pb facs="tcp:6506:10"/> this doctrine, for the benefit of all who heard me: and now at the importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſome, I publiſh it in writing, to the profit, I hope, of many more.</p>
            <p>The order I haue vſed is as famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar and plaine, as I could, labouring to profit rather the moſt, then to ſatisfie the learned. I haue begun with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it, and haue examined the ſeuerall particulars thereof; then I haue proceeded to the eſſentiall and naturall parts of it; from them to the cauſes of it; from the cauſes, to the ſubiect and parties to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and who ought to practiſe this dutie; from theſe vnto thoſe ſeuen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable fruits or effects, which the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſecond Epiſtle to the Corinthes hath deliuered vnto vs. <note place="margin">2.

Finally, I haue laboured to remooue ſome of thoſe principall lets and impediments, which Satan caſteth in the way of all men, when they ſhall but once mind their way to his holie dutie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:6506:10"/>
            <p>I cannot ſay, I haue brought here any thing new and vnheard of; <hi>For there is no new thing vnder the Sunne:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.9.</note> For matter I meane; yet for the manner and particular han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling of it, I know none, who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the capacity of the meaneſt, as I haue endeuoured, to my power and for my skill, to doe.</p>
            <p>What doe our Lawyers pleade now, but that which hath been pleaded in former times, the ſame ſtatutes, the ſame rules of law, the ſame book caſes? onely they applie them to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cauſes, and fit them for the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their clients. What doe our Phyſitians preſcribe now, any thing but that which <hi>Galene, Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> and other Phyſitians haue done before them? the ſame ſimples and compounds, the ſame purges, and preſeruatiues, the ſame cordials and reſtoratiues; onely by their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and skill, liuing among vs, they diſcerne of the ſtate of the patient, of his age, ſtrength and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the diſeaſe, whether new or

As lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle able are we to bring any new thing, but only fit them to the times and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, ſeeing liuing in the ſame ages, wee may the better bee able to doe it, though we be many degrees inferiour in gifts and knowledge. That I then profeſſe, is the more particular, and familiar handling and applying of theſe things, which others haue wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilie deliuered, for the benefit of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>I haue endeuoured to confirme eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie point by the word of truth, and haue added (after my vſuall manner) confirmations &amp; illuſtrations drawne from reaſon, ſimilitude, and the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Fathers; not to ſtrengthen the Scriptures, but to helpe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the hearer and reader, to whom all is little enough, to make him heare with attention and delite, to conceiue with profit, and to carry away for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.

Now when men haue grace to repent, then they begin to renew this fellowſhip, to recouer this image, and to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6506:16"/> to God; therefore I call it a turning againe to God, and a change of the condition.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6506:16"/> but then why ſhould not carnall and worldly ſorrow be repentance; when carnall men mourne for the loſſe of wife or child, or ſome loſſe by fire or water, ſea or land? Some thinke it is a little weeping or grieuing, when they are made to ſee their ſinnes, or rather the puniſhment due to them; but then why did not <hi>Eſau</hi> repent? Others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that a little humbling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to hang downe the head like a bulruſh, to faſt certain daies and to put on ſackcloth, is repentance; but then why was not <hi>Ahabs</hi> repentance good and true? Others deceiue themſelues by an opinion that good words and good purpoſes is repentance; but then why ſhould not thoſe ſicke men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, who haue manie goodly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and purpoſes, which they neuer performe nor bring to perfection, if once they haue crept from vnder Gods hand, and haue worne away the circles of his ſtrokes?

But ſome will grant vs that it muſt be a turning, and will practiſe a change, yet that is but from one ſinne to another, as the prodigall man leaues off his prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,

And in this endeuor though a mans beſt way is to begin with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, as in purging a chanell, the beſt is to begin in the fountaine and the ſpring head: yet leſt the hardnes and difficultie of the worke may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him, make him faint in it and giue ouer; I would deale with him, as ſchoole-maſters doe with children, which teach them the eaſieſt things firſt, though they be not ſo needfull and profitable: and perſwade him to begin with the change of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6506:18"/> man, being eaſier to compaſſe, then the change of the inward and diſpoſition of the mind. He muſt then call himſelfe to an examination for the ſinnes whereun to he is addicted; and finding them to be fornication, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, drunkenneſſe, theft, vſury, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſwearing, or the like; he muſt make this reſolution, vtterly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them all, and for euer, be they (as no doubt they may be) neuer ſo ſweet, bring they in neuer ſuch pleaſure or profit; yet muſt he turne from them all and vtterlie breake them off. And to that end carefully auoid all manner of occaſions and prouocations entiſing and drawing to theſe ſinnes, by which he is either put in minde of them, or tempted to commit them. By which care, God aſſiſting of him, the weakeſt man that is ſubiect to any ſinne, may get the maſtery ouer it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he that is furtheſt from that ſin, may eaſily be ouertaken, if he auoid not the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As a weake man may keepe his treaſure long, that can keep his doores ſhut, and theeues out, when as a ſtrong man ſhall be ſoone robbed of it, if he let in the theeues. Now when hee is able to abſtaine from theſe, then muſt he endeuoury contrary good workes,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6506:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> as we heard <hi>Daniel</hi> counſelled <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar: Zaccheus</hi> practiſed, and <hi>Peter</hi> perſwaded his repentants: <note place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note>

Yet ſay I not that he ſhall loſe his labour, for he may by it procure to himſelfe the fauour of God for ſome forbearance and ſparing in temporall iudgement, or obtaining of ſome earthly bleſſing, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did. But if he would truly repent he muſt endeuour to purge the mind from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, his will from frowardnes and peruerſnes, his affections from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and vncleanneſſe, and labour to haue knowledge of the myſteries of ſaluation in his vnderſtanding, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe in his will, holineſſe in his affections; not onely abſtaining from groſſe ſinnes or liuing vnblamable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, but from all ſmall and ſecret ſinnes, by keeping a good conſcience in all his waies in the ſight of God, not leauing ſome ſinnes onely but all, not doing ſome good onely, but labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to doe all knowne duties, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the fleſh and the heart, making

In order of nature faith goeth before; in the manifeſtation of them, repentance is firſt; in time they are both ioyntly together. For by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, firſt a mans conſcience muſt in ſome ſort be ſetled, touching his reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation with God by Chriſt, before hee can repent. As <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nemo rectè poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit poenitentiam agere, niſi qui ſperauerit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgentiam. Ambroſ. de poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>No man can rightly repent, vnleſſe he hope for pardon.</hi> So that firſt Gods fauour is apprehended, and remiſſion of ſinnes beleeued, then vpon that commeth repentance, alteration of life, and conuerſion. But for manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6506:22"/> repentance both to a mans ſelfe and to another goes before faith, for it is ſooner diſcerned then faith. Iuſtification is like the ſap hid within the barke, when as repentance as the bud, ſpeedily ſheweth it ſelfe, before leafe, bloſſome, or fruit. Laſtly, if we reſpect the time, neither of them is one before the other, but are begotten in a man both at one inſtant, for faith is not begotten to day, and repentance to morrow, or ſome daies after, but he that beleeues inſtantly repented, though it be not ſo perceiued, no not of him that poſſeſſeth both. As the thunder crack and lightning are both at one and the ſame time, yet is one diſcerned before the other. All that this ſheweth or we would prooue by is, is this, that none can ſeriouſlie and trulie repent, but he that knowes he is Gods, none can know this but he that hath his grace and this faith.</p>
            <p>Ob. 3. Further it may be ſome will obiect, that many a man by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of his conſcience is ſubdued and brought to obedience long before he hath faith or grace, or hath taſted of it; and ſo it ariſeth not from thence.</p>
            <p>Anſ. I anſwere, this is no other then that which may come of nature from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:6506:23"/> the knowledge of good and euill by that conſcience of ſinne which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in man ſince his fall, being but a ſeruill ſeare of puniſhment and of the anger of God; which though it he not a proper worke of Gods ſanctifying ſpirit, nor any part of regeneration, yet is it a ſtep towards it, and to bee nouriſhed, becauſe it is as the needle to the thread, for it makes way for the true feere of God.</p>

Beſides, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that repentance is the worke of a liuing man, of him that is ſpirituallie liuing no dead man can repent, But he that is with out faith, though he haue a name to liue, yet is dead: for, <note place="margin">Habac. 2.4.</note>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6506:23"/> to holines. That, a naturall man may haue; this, onely a ſpirituall: that, a dead man may performe; this, onely a liuing man. Finally, repentance is a purifying of the heart, a mortifying, and crucifying of the fleſh: and what ſhall purifie the heart? is it not faith? for whom will a man crucifie his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued ſinnes, inortifie his fleſh and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? will he do it for any, but for him of whoſe loue he is ſpecially aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?

               </note> True ſauing repentance ariſeth from the true knowledge of a mans owne ſpirituall eſtate; and none can repent but they who haue this knowledge; which is proued by the courſe which was euer taken by thoſe who laboured to bring and induce offenders to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, for they laboured euer to ſet before their eies and to make them ſee the condition wherein they were. The Lord himſelfe when he came to viſit <hi>Adam,</hi> who had now ſinned, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6506:27"/> to draw him to repentance, tooke this courſe with him; ſaying vnto him, <note place="margin">Gen. 3.9.</note> 
               <hi>Adam where art thou?</hi> that is, in what a caſe art thou: ſee and knowe that howſoeuer thou art in the ſame place, yet thou art not in the ſame condition, and take notice of thy miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that by it thou maiſt be drawne to ſeeke to me and not to flie from me. So the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi>

So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 2.36.</note> in his firſt ſermon after the aſcenſion of Chriſt, endeuoured to make the Iewes his auditors to ſee their ſinnes in cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Lord of life, and their wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched eſtate for that fact, that he might, as the ſucceſſe was, draw them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. So Chriſt himſelfe with the Church of Laodicea, to the end he might make her truly repent, laboured to abate her pride, which blinded her eyes, and to make her ſee that ſhe was, <hi>wretched and miſerable, and blind and poore, and naked.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Reuelat. 3.17.</note> And this <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of her ſelfe, ſheweth, that it was

               <hi>When I was inſtructed, I repented.</hi> As if ſhe ſhould ſay, when my eies were open, that I ſaw my owne condition and eſtate, then I repented. By all theſe it is cleere that repentance ariſeth from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a mans ſpirituall eſtate. But to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue this point more fully, we muſt vnderſtand that there are three parts of this knowledge, or three things are required to make a man know himſelfe and his eſtate throughly. 1. That he know his ſinne. 2. That he haue the ſenſe of his ſin, that is, of the puniſhment and curſe due to his ſinne. 3 The knowledge of his owne ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to free himſelfe, either from the ſinne, or from the puniſhment due to ſinne. The firſt of theſe is, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a mans ſinfulnes, his naturall ſinfulneſſe, that by nature without temptation he is inclinable to all euill, and vtterly vnable to doe good: Then his inward ſinfulnes, that is, his ſecret motions which ſhould bee towards God and agreeable to his law, are altogether auerſe from him toward ſinne and diſobedience; theſe are his thoughts, luſt and concupiſcence of the ſoule: Laſtly, his outward actions both his ſinnes of omiſſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6506:28"/> his apparent euill, and his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect good things. The knowledge of all which are to be had by the law, for <note place="margin">Rom. 3.20.</note> 
               <hi>by the law commeth the knowledge of ſin.</hi> The 2. part of this knowledge is the ſenſe of ſin, that is, the knowledge of the curſe and puniſhment due vnto ſin, for that is it which makes ſinne ſenſible to a man. Thus God dealt with the wicked when he had laid before them their ſins, as it is in the 50. Pſalm. verſ. 18. <note place="margin">Pſalm. 50.18.</note> 
               <hi>When thou ſeeſt a theeſe thou runneſt with him, &amp;c.</hi> Then he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his iudgements againſt them, verſ. 22. <note place="margin">Verſe 22.</note> 
               <hi>I will teare you in peeces, &amp;c.</hi> To make them the more ſenſible. Now theſe are either ſpirituall plagues, or ourſes vpon their bodies, goods, wiues, children, friends, or vpon their name, memorie and poſteritie. All which may bee found in the Word, as Deut. 28. and ſuch like. The 3. part is, the knowledge of a mans owne inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, either to free himſelfe from the ſinne, or the puniſhment due vnto it: that howſoeuer he may by his naturall ſtrength repreſſe the rage of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, prune and lop it, cutting off the ſuperfluous bowes and branches of it, yet the roote and the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die will remaine ſtill in his heart and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6506:28"/> ſoule, and will as occaſion is offered breake forth into all his members. And this is it which made <hi>Dauid</hi> to repent and pray ſo earneſtly to the Lord to purge him: <note place="margin">Pſalm. 51.2.7.</note> 
               <hi>Waſh me throughly from mine iniquities, and purge me from my ſinne.</hi> And againe: <hi>Purge me with hyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſope and I ſhall be cleane.</hi> And that hee is as little able to auoid the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either by hiding himſelfe, or by any wit or powet, or any meanes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: which was in them whom <hi>Peter</hi> preached to, and made them come with this note to <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles: <note place="margin">Act. 2.37.</note> 
               <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we doe to be ſaued?</hi> The like was in the gaoler, who came trembling to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> and ſaid, <note place="margin">Act. 16.30.</note> 
               <hi>Sirs what may I doe to be ſaued?</hi> So that it is manifeſt that the knowledge and ſenſe of ſinne and the conſcience of a mans owne inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to free himſelfe from either, will make a man turne to God and repent.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſons of this truth are theſe. <note place="margin" type="runSum">

            <p>Now the vſe wee haue to make of this point is this: <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> Firſt, to informe vs that the world and the Church hath many thouſand impenitent ſinners, ſuch as neuer haue repented, neither yet (in the caſe wherein they are) are they capable of repentance, becauſe they are ignorant of their ſpirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; and that which is worſt, they cannot be perſwaded to looke into it: though they often caſt vp their eſtate to know what it is, I meane their worldly eſtate, yet they neuer ballance their ſpirituall eſtate, being either
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6506:30"/> ſlothfull and negligent, or elſe being poſſeſſed with a falſe opinion of the vnneceſſarines of it, or with feare of the deſperateneſſe of it; like as ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerupts who are not able to pay a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in the pound, dare not looke into their eſtate, leſt they procure griefe and diſcontentment to themſelues. Whatſoeuer the cauſe is, the thing is not done, and ſo they are without the knowledge of it: and whatſoeuer they thinke of themſelues, if impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners muſt periſh, they cannot bee ſafe, feeing they cannot repent; which they cannot doe, as long as they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of themſelues and of their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eſtate. If any man think it ſtrange, that man, who knoweth ſo many things ſhould be ignorant of himſelfe, when this is proper and peculiar to him to know himſelfe; <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.11.</note> 
               <hi>For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſaue the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man which is in him?</hi> he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not that when the obiect is nie to, or laid vpon the ſenſe, it nothing ſo well diſcerneth it, and the eie of the bodie, though it behold all other things, yet it cannot ſee it ſelf, or ſome parts of the bodie which are neereſt vnto it. So the mind of man compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the whole world, ſometimes the

But by the particulars this will more appeare. For many can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perſwaded that they are ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt dynature, but their nature ſeemes to them to be pure, beautiful, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, thinking it no more corrupt, then it was created by God, and then it was in <hi>Adam</hi> during the time of his innocencie. Hence are thoſe opinions of perfect inherent righteouſnes, iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by works, and merit of works, of the power of pure naturals, free will and ſuch like, which Papiſts and other heretiks haue inuented and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of the naturall or affected ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6506:31"/> of mans eſtate.

Further, for meane and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſinnes they thinke them veniall and light offences, not to bee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, or auoided; they thinke their good meaning to be as good as perfect holines; their owne righteouſnes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and abſolute, ſo that they ſay in effect: <note place="margin">Reuel. 3.17.</note>

Example hereof we haue in <hi>Ezra,</hi> who was ſo farre humbled for the ſinnes of the people that he ſaid vnto God: <note place="margin">Ezra 9.6.</note> 
               <hi>I am confounded and aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to lift vp mine eies vnto thee my God, for our iniquities are increaſed ouer our heads, and our treſpaſſe is grown vp vnto the heauen:</hi> ſo ought euery man
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6506:42"/> when he commeth before God, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be aſhamed and confounded in himſelfe for his own ſinnes, and think that it belongeth vnto him whatſoeuer he is, not onely to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed when he is in the ſight of the world and in the view of men, but when he is in his ſecret chamber or cloſet, when none but God can be an eie-witnes thereof: thus were <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> aſhamed of themſelues when there was not a man nor a woman more in the world to look vpon them, yet were they aſhamed of their owne nakednes when they beheld the ſame. And to this ſhame muſt he ioyne ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: ſorrow for ſin and for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that belongeth vnto it. But if he would haue that which God requires and will accept, hee muſt labour for that ſorrow which the Goſpell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth, which proceeds from the conſideration of the goodnes of God, that is, becauſe hee hath offended ſo good and ſo grations a God.</p>
            <p>Some may ſay, what meaſure of ſorrow do you require euery man to haue?</p>
            <p>Euery mans ſorrow ſhould be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his ſinnes, all mens ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes are not alike, neither is it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6506:42"/> neceſſarie; indeed that euery man ſhould haue ſorrow, that is neceſſarie, but there is a difference to be found among men, ariſing thus: Sometime from the greatnes and ſmalnes of their ſinnes: for as a burthen, the heauier it is the more it preſſeth downe; ſo the ſinnes of men the greater they are the heauier they are, and the more they humble men and preſſe them down with ſorrow, ſo that according to a mans ſinnes ſo is his ſorrow. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the ſin makes diſſimilitude in ſorrow: ſome mens ſins are like bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that are ſoone cured with the pricking of a needle, others are like wounds or ſores that will not be cured without the lancing of a raſor; ſo ſome mens ſinnes are cured with a little ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, others muſt haue more. In all, the rule of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> is general: <note place="margin">

               <hi>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proportion of thy ſinnes ſo ſhould thy teares be. If thy ſinne be great, greater muſt bee the ſtreames of thy teares.</hi> Sometimes alſo there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence according to the preſent afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and iudgements that are vpon men, either when their afflictions are greater and their conſcience agreeth with them, as the cauſe and effect, for then <note place="margin">Prou. 18.14.</note>

Sometime there is a difference, becauſe ſome men the Lord deferres longer before he ſheweth them grace and fauour, oftentimes to proue their patience, or to make them pray more earneſtly, which maketh their ſorrow the greater; and another man calleth, and God ſheweth him grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor preſentlie, that he is ſcarſe knowne to goe by the way of ſorrow to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. So we reade of <hi>Lydia,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> for wee reade nothing of her ſorrow, but of her conuerſion. Laſtly, there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, becauſe ſome men haue often bin in the ſchoole of repentance, and haue been often humbled, others haue neuer before been humbled. Now as to him that hath bin often vnder the Phyſitians hand, and is daily taking ſome of his receits, more gentle me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are ſufficient, when as he that neuer was, muſt haue ſharper potions: ſo muſt it be with theſe. From theſe or ſome ſuch like cauſes there ariſeth a difference in mens ſorrowes: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, of euery man there is required ſorrow for his ſinnes, or elſe no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6506:43"/> of ſinnes: but for the quantitie of it (for me) he muſt be his owne Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, ſeeing he, and not we know the greatnes of his ſinnes. For euen in ſome diſeaſes Phyſitians who preſcribe the medicine, leaue the quantitie to be taken at the patients diſcretion. Then let euery man examine himſelfe in this caſe, and if he haue found that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer paſſed by this gate of ſorrow and humiliation, he can neuer come to the throne of grace. Hath any man liued 20. 30. 40. or 50. yeers, and yet can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſay that he was ſorie or aſhamed before God for his ſinnes? he is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in the ſtate of impenitencie, and hath not receiued the remiſſion of his ſinnes, but all his ſinnes from his cradle vnto this day, are written before God in a piller of marble, with a pen of iron neuer to be blotted out, vntill he haue obtained this. Then let him labour to get a heart and eyes to ſee his ſinnes, and to applie to himſelfe the curſe of the law and the wrath of God, to make him ſeeke to God in humilitie, that he may obtaine his mercie; for vntill he be come to this condition, he deceiueth his owne heart, if he thinke he haue obtained mercie; but being thus humbled, and hauing ſhame, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,

And therefore this inward humble repentant muſt put on a black mourning weede, that as he is in ſoule and conſcience caſt down by the ſight of his ſinne, and ſenſe of the wrath of God; ſo he may behaue himſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and expreſſe his inward hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6506:46"/> in all his words, deeds, and in the whole courſe of his life: which he ought to labour for, as for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before, ſo becauſe it will be very profitable for him in reſpect of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for the confirming and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it. For as it is in all other parts of holineſſe, the more they are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the bodie in life and action, the more they are confirmed and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inwardly in the ſoule: ſo the more that a man giueth himſelfe to the vſe of all outward exerciſes of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before men, the more doth hee humble himſelfe in the ſight of God. Therefore labour for this, that thou maiſt increaſe thy true humiliation to thy comfort. All this while I ſpeake of particular and ordinarie outward hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and repentance, which is not neceſſarily required that it ſhould be done publikely. It is a thing that hath beene obſerued in many, that they breake forth into teares and ſighings in the congregation; I ſimplie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it not, I would iudge chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablie of it: but yet if I may aduiſe them, I thinke it fit they abſtaine from ſuch outward things in publike place, and doe it betwixt God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, rather when they are alone,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6506:47"/> knowing not what conſtruction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may make of it.

               <hi>Q.</hi> But is there none other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar confeſſion? <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is no other of any abſolute neceſſitie, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it may be neceſſarie, that is, when a man is diſtracted in his minde and is diſcomforted, and can finde no comfort in himſelfe, nor is able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply vnto himſelf the comforts of God, he is bound to confeſſe his griefe to ſome who is able to applie vnto him the promiſes of the Goſpel, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying of his ſpiritual malady, as much as a man that is bodily ſicke and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cure himſelfe, is bound to ſend for a Phyſitian, and ſhew him his griefe, that he may helpe to cure him. But ſo, as he is not bound to any one man, or that he muſt needes be a Preacher or a Miniſter, ſo he make choice of an able man, well experienced, truſtie and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: for often times in the matter of conſcience, or diſtraction of minde, a priuate man may giue more comfort then many a good Preacher. As in the bodie, in many diſeaſes an experienced man who hath been ſubiect to, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:6506:49"/> of them, can better tell how to helpe and cure another, then a learned Phyſitian, who is without that home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred experience: ſo many a priuate man, by his owne experience of the terrors of his conſcience, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious comforts he found from God in due time, can better tell how to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter a word of comfort, and ſhall more fitly doe it, then many a learned. Miniſter, who neuer had the like ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and ſo not the like experience. As the Apoſtle ſpeaketh generallie: <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.4.</note> 
               <hi>God hath comforted vs in all our tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any tribulation, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort wherewith we our ſelues are comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God.</hi> And this confeſſion wee ſpeake of is a neceſſarie thing, for all ſuch as bee in the condition mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whether they be learned, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, whether of the Laitie, or of the Clergie, euen to one as well as to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For oftentimes it may fall to a Miniſter to haue this trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and diſtraction of mind, ſo that he ſhall not be able to adminiſter comfort to himſelfe. <hi>Baſil</hi> hath ſuch a ſaying, That a Phyſitian (bee hee neuer ſo skilfull or expert) yet being fallen into ſome diſeaſe, may by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:6506:50"/> of the paſſion or extremitie of his ſicknes, which may breed and bring obliuion of his Art, be often not able to helpe himſelfe, but bee forced to ſeeke helpe of another: ſo a Miniſter may be in that condition, that he may be driuen to ſeeke helpe and comfort of another man, and ſo had need to confeſſe as well as another.</p>
            <p>But ſome will demand what I think of the confeſſion of Poperie, which is preſſed vpon men to be made of al ſins, and that to a Prieſt vpon paine of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

And that euen the beſt and moſt regenerate men will tell vs, that they find in their natures, an inclination to the moſt foulleſt ſins in the world, if ſhame, feare, or the grace of God did not reſtraine them; who know well enough what adoe they haue with their corrupt natures, to keepe them within the compaſſe of obedience.

Often they haue been content to loſe many an ounce of blood for the health of their bodie, but yet could neuer bee content to part with a pound or a ſhilling of their coine to make reftitution for the health of their ſoule, but liuing, and dying, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of iniquitie are found in their houſes, as we heard before out of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha.</hi>

Then thou wilt thinke to make thy ſonne happie, according to the prouerbe, by going to the Diuell, and yet ſhall hee be indeede miſerable by the curſe of God. But what if a man haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? This is a diſpenſation: and as the prouerbe is, Where there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be had, the King muſt loſe his right: euen ſo here; and repentance is then ſufficient, ſo that thou haue a mind, that as God ſhall make thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, thou wilt reſtore. But it may bee that thou hadſt gotten thy goods wickedly before thy calling to Chriſt; now if thou ſhouldeſt begin to make reſtitution, thou wilt ſay, it would either diſhonour thy calling and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, or giue ſome enemie aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ouer thee, for thy hurt.

The worldings prouerbe indeede
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:6506:64"/> is; It is a ſhame to ſteale, but a greater ſhame to bring home againe. Yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thou that no ſhame to thee in ſome honeſt manner to bring home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine all that which thou haſt ſtollen by deceit or oppreſſion, or howſoeuer, ſeeing others are honoured of all ages for it; ſpecially in as much as no reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is damnation, and reſtitution is the way to ſaluation. Againe, I do not ſo vrge this, that of neceſſitie a man muſt-ſhame himſelfe; for it is lawfull for a man to prouide for his credit, ſo he do the thing, and be as warie in the manner as he can. For example, if thou haſt deceiued thy brother ſecretly and vnknowne to him, which was ſinne in thee; thou maiſt make him reſtitution againe vnknowne to him, and that be a righteous thing in thee. Yet more particularly in one inſtance for the reſt: Thou art a trades man, and the partie iniured trades with thee ſtill, reſtore him that thou defraudeſt him of, either by weight, meaſure, or price, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, in the ſame kinde, ſecretly, as <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ſteward put <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in their bagges and ſacks; and doe this at times by little and little, till thy conſcience which checked thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tell thee thou haſt done him

But take this caueat with thee; beware thou flatter not thy ſelfe and reſtore not all, becauſe no man knoweth whether thou doeſt or not: for he that is the ſearcher of the heart knoweth all. But if thou wanteſt opportunitie to doe it ſecretly, rather then it ſhould not be done, thou muſt do it publikely, and that vpon no leſſe penaltie then dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For the contrarie muſt needes be to that of Chriſt to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> That no reſtitution excludes ſaluation out of thy houſe and heart. <hi>For,</hi> as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">

Then the firſt entrance of obedience muſt be the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of theſe, and the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this corruption. But it muſt bee vnderſtood that when I ſay the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant mortifies ſinne, I ſpeake of all ſins, not whole ſinne, for euery ſinne muſt bee in part mortified, though no man can wholly mortifie his ſinne; the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſinne may bee deſtroyed, but the ſtumps of ſinne will remaine in euery man to goe to the graue with him, as it

                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> 1. The firſt vſe of this doctrine is to teach vs, that if this be a part of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then is it not ſo eaſie a thing, as the world takes it to be to repent, and turne from ſinne; for if it were onelie the turning and changing of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act of ſin, the leauing of all theſe vaine, and idle, laſciuious, and wanton ſpeeches, of the act of oppreſſion, vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, adulterie, theft, prophaning of the Sabbath, ſwearing and a thouſand ſuch like, wherewith the life of a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds: yet is it not a thing ſo eaſilie compaſſed, as men do dreame, becauſe of the profit, pleaſure, and delight, which they bring vnto them, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth euery man, both in himſelfe and others. But when that is had it is nothing to the other. If this be ſo hard, what is it to kill, crucifie, and mortifie, a mans affections and ſinnes? as deare vnto him as his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and therfore ſo called, <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>Mortifie your members.</hi> If it be a hard thing for a man to indure a little drawing ſalue, which drawes away the corrupt blood and humors which hinder the healing of the wound, what wil it be to endure plaiſters, and coraſiues which ſhould eate to the very bone? And if a man
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:6506:67"/> cannot endure the mortifying of one member of one ioynt, how ſhall he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the mortifying of all the ioynts of the hand, or of the bodie? Such a thing is repentance, and the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of al the luſts of man, as neere and deere as members to him. Therefore you deceiue your ſelues, when you thinke that repentance is ſo eaſie a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that you can performe it when you are old and ſicke; ſeeing now when you are young and ſtrong, and in health, you cannot indure the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of one member, how wil you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure then the mortifying of all, or of thoſe ſins which are as deere as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</p>

Againe, this ſerueth to teach vs that many men deceiue themſelues, with an opinion and conceit of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that they haue repented, when they neuer had the firſt part of it: many neuer hauing any change at all of any act, or way wherein they haue walked, and the moſt neuer came to killing, and crucifying, nor to any mortifying of any ſinne, or any affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is as if a wounded man, who hath a feſtered wound, which hath long been ſo, ſhould thinke that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Surgion hath but once blowed

Then how do theſe dreame, and are deceiued that thus perſwade themſelues of repenting, when they haue not the firſt part of it; nor euer could endure that the ſword of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or the biting or eating ſalues of the law and iudgements of God, ſhould come nigh them, but either endeuour to driue away theſe ſpirituall ſurgions, or to withdraw themſelues from them?

               <note place="margin">Ierem. 4.</note> Hee that returnes to him, hath renewed fellowſhip and vnion with him, which he loſt by his ſin: but this cannot be, if he be not renewed, and walk in the light. As S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">1. Iohn 1.6.7.</note> 
               <hi>If wee ſay we haue fellowſhip with him, and walke in darknes, we lie, and doe not truly.

But it muſt be vnderſtood that this regeneration is not perfect,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:6506:71"/> ſo that man is not perfectly holy by an inherent holineſſe; but as whole ſinne is not aboliſhed, ſo neither is this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation perfect, and ſanctification wholly obtained.

               <hi>Let not ſinne reigne in your mortall bodies.</hi> Hee doth not ſay, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine, Let not ſin be in your mortall bodies,</hi> for that cannot be obtained, but <hi>let it not reigne,</hi> that is, let it not haue dominion and rule ouer you.

               <hi>The fleſh luſteth against the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe two are contrarie:</hi> by fleſh vnderſtanding nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, by ſpirit the regenerate part. Now theſe two are contrary, and while a man is in this life, he ſhall neuer be free from this fight; the experience of all regenerate teacheth the ſame. Yea euen S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe found this; <note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> 
               <hi>That the law of his members rebelled againſt the law of his mind, leading him captiue to ſinne.</hi> And he was neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and free from this inward corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If you aske then what is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Chriſt? I anſwere, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider two things in ſinne: 1. The guilt of ſinne, which the Schoolemen call the <hi>forme</hi> of ſinne. The ſecond is the corruption of ſinne, which they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:6506:71"/> call the <hi>matter</hi> of ſin. Wee ſay that in euery regenerate man, the guilt is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and the forme of ſinne is wholly gone, but the matter in part remaineth; and when we ſpeake of mortification, wee doe not ſay that a man that hath repented, hath all his ſinnes and affections wholly mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſo farre as the ſtrength and power of them is broken and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but the ſtumps of them remaine ſtill. As the Apoſtle to the Romanes ſaith; <note place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> 
               <hi>By Chriſt our old man is crucified, that the bodie of ſin might be deſtroyed.</hi> Not that ſinne is vtterly gone, for that cannot be in this life, but the ſtrength and power of it is deſtroyed. Now if ſinne bee not wholly mortified, a man cannot bee wholly regenerated, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are both mixt together, for the corruption of the one is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the other, and if the whole bee not corrupted, then part muſt needes bee regenerate, for all things are but here in part, and muſt after be perfected. And the Lord hath ſo dealt, to leaue corruption in men, to the end he might humble them in the ſight of it, and to ſharpen their prayers. This vſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> made of it, <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.7.</note> when he had the buffet of Satan, and the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6506:72"/> prick of the fleſh to humble him, and to make him the more feruent to God by prayer, to giue him grace to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it. So hath God ordained that men ſhould not come to perfection in this life, to humble them in the ſight of their ſinnes, and that their prayers might be made vnto him with more earneſtnes and feruencie, for ſtrength againſt their infirmities. And here wee may applie that of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing men into three ſorts: <hi>Some</hi> (ſaith he) <note place="margin">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6506:72"/> part of repentance, and that there is none which is true, ſound and ſauing repentance, but it hath neceſſarilie theſe two parts: as there is no man but bee hath, and conſiſteth of ſoule and bodie, and one part maketh not a man: then not onely prophane and wicked men, are without repentance, but many others alſo, who haue made a good reformation in the outward man, and haue a ſhew of this godlines, but not the power of it; doing all this but for ſome ſiniſter reſpect, vpon ſome vaine glorie, pride or conceit of merit, or expectation of reward, or ſuch like. For in their mindes they diſallow not the euil, that they in former times committed, becauſe it is euill, neither now approue the good, becauſe it is good. Againe, in their willes they reiect not the euill, and decline from it becauſe it is euill, nor allowing the good, and incline thereto, becauſe it is good. 3. In their hearts they hate not the euill, becauſe it is euil, but as the dog caſteth vp his vomit, becauſe it is troubleſome; nor loue and affect the good, becauſe it is good, but for that it brings good to them. And that which is worſt, in all theſe they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue and gratulate themſelues; which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6506:73"/> argueth that they are farre from this true regeneration which doth theſe for Gods ſake, becauſe they are good, and checks a man when hee hath er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or indirect affections to them, and conceits of them; and ſo ſhewes that they are farre from regeneration, and inward holines, which leaues out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things and appearances, becauſe they are like that which it ſelfe is in deed and in trueth. And that for all this outward reformation, ſuch men haue not artained to true and ſound repentance. And though this is not ſo apparant to men, that are afarre off, and conuerſe not with them, yet is it to them that ſhall be nigh them, and ſee their conuerſation, who may eaſily diſeerne it by their ſpeeches, the meſſenger of the mind, <note place="margin">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:6506:73"/> ſecuritie, and not without the checkes of his conſcience; which though he may ſmother for a time, yet will they haue their fruit at length in him as in <hi>Dauid.</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2.</note> The ſecond vſe is, to perſwade euery man, to labour to be regenerated and renewed in the whole man, as he hath bin corrupted in the whole; and to be reſolued, that though he cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed bee wholy renewed, yet muſt he be ſo in the whole, that is, in ſome meaſure in euery part. For no man muſt looke to be renewed here in that meaſure he was corrupted, either in the inward or the outward man, and ſo to attaine to perfection of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; but the true repentant beginning by a little and little, both may and ought to increaſe more and more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perfection. As it was with <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> when hee was purged from his leproſie, his fleſh came againe as the fleſh of a yong child: ſo when as man is purged from the leproſie of ſinne, hee beginneth to bee renewed as a childe groweth, who hath all the parts of a man, but not the perfection of any: ſo hath this true repentant, all the parts of regeneration, but not any one in perfection: hee hath all parts
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:6506:74"/> ſomwhat reformed, though not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reformed; I ſay, hee is both in the will, mind and affections, though not perfectly. For this muſt euery one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and though his grace bee but ſmall in the beginning, yet muſt he not bee diſcouraged, for it is the ſtate of all the children of God, that a long time corruption will be greater then grace, a long time there will be more chaffe then corne in them. But if he in the meane while diſlike his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and bewaile his defects, hee may aſſure himſelfe he hath his meaſure of regeneration; for no man can doe ſo in truth, but he that is regenerat. Yet let no man thinke that becauſe he hath ſomewhat, and is in part regenerate, therefore he hath enough, and ſo fet downe his reſt, as if hee neede goe no further; for then ſhall hee deceiue himſelfe, ſeeing the true ſanctifying grace is ſeede that will and doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and multiplie; not ſalt, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth and maketh barren. If men then doe not increaſe and grow in their graces, they haue good cauſe to ſuſpect them to be rather counterfeit then currant: If they doe increaſe, they may be aſſured their graces are of the right ſtampe indeede.</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:6506:74"/>
            <p>But ſome man wil happily demand, how much he is bound to increaſe, or what meaſure of increaſe will proue his graces to be true? I anſwere him, that according to the meanes God hath giuen him, and the time he hath liued vnder thoſe meanes, and the opportunitie hee had to vſe them, ſo much ought he to increaſe. For as in temporall things euery man groweth according to the meanes he hath, and the time for the vſe of his meanes: ſo in ſpirituall things euery man that hath true grace, ought to haue it ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing; and he may be aſſured that if it be hid in a napkin, and continue without increaſe, it is not true grace. So that many men who pleaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues becauſe they haue had ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of good motions, now and then, in which yet they haue not gone forward, nor increaſed anſwerable to their meanes, haue deceiued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, while they haue iudged them true and ſufficient.

               <hi>Oh Ephraim, what ſhall I doe vnto thee? Oh Iuda how ſhall Lintreate thee? for your goodnes is as a morning cloude, and as the morning dew

So if a man had the oyle of repentance, to forſake ſinne, and to turne vnto God, in his owne power, it were ſomewhat leſſe folly to deferre it; but whereas hee hath it not, what folly and madnes were it for him to deferre it, till Chriſt come,

Secondly, this teacheth vs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the happie condition of that people, or that nation or place, whereſoeuer God hath vouchſafed the preaching of the word, to wit, that it is a mauifeſt proofe hee hath a people there that hee would conuert, and hath a deſire to ſaue them.

               <hi>Feare not, but ſpeake, for I haue much people in this place;</hi> Arguing that he had a people there whom hee meant to ſaue, and therefore hee ſent his word to them.

               <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the euening let not thine hand reſt: for thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper, this or that,</hi> &amp;c. So ought a man to take all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to heare the word, for he knoweth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:6506:86"/> not at what time God will beſtow this mercie and grace of repentance vpon him. It may bee, euen then when hee ſought worldlie bleſſings, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after profits and pleaſures, if he had been as carefull and eager to heare, hee might haue obtained this, and God would haue wrought it in his heart. Happily his thoughts are, if he take not that opportunity for worldly things, he may not a long time haue the like againe; and neuer thinkes that it may bee his caſe in this thing. But let him remember that <hi>Iacob</hi> had the bleſſing when <hi>Eſau</hi> was a hunting: and ſo that many attend to this and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſaluation by it, when hee is a hunting after pleaſures, and profits and ſuch like. I know God is able indeede to touch him and call him wherſoeuer he ſtraieth, and without theſe meanes; and I know that that is the thought of many mens harts, which maketh them ſo to neglect the meanes as they doe, and all becauſe ſome were ſo called. But theſe men muſt know, that as God ceaſed to feed Iſrael from heauen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, when he had ſet them in the land of Canaan, and gaue them meanes to liue ordinarily; which if they neglected they could haue loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:6506:87"/> for nothing elſe but to famiſh and periſh: So hath he in this; neither may any man look for ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie things, who neglecteth the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. For ſuch wicked tempting of God, will prouoke him rather to leaue him to himſelfe, to bee hardned and made more obſtinate, than to worke extraordinarily for him. Therefore muſt hee bee ſwift to heare, that ſo vſing the meanes (ſpecially with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and diligence) he may obtaine the bleſſing. Yet muſt he not bee ſo ſwift in this, as ſlow to ſpeake; I meane not, ſlow to ſpeake of the word in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with others, but not to ſpeake againſt it, nor to quarell with it, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning and reaſoning againſt it: as it is the manner of ſome, who will be ſwift to heare; I ſay they will heare much and often, but withall they will reiect euery thing that is not directly to their minds (as if a miniſter muſt bee a tailer, to ſhape euery garment after their crooked loynes, and liues) or elſe they will queſtion with this man and that concerning ſuch a point, but neuer wil once queſtion with their Miniſter, or him of whom they heard that, which argueth they haue only a ſpirit of contradiction, and no deſire

But ſpecially if they bee ſlow to wrath, and be not offended when they haue their ſinnnes touched.

Hence is it, that in a iudgement from God, when they are feared, or afflicted, they grieue not that they haue diſhonoured him, but onely that they haue dipleaſed him, and procured ſuch hard things to themſelues, and ſo repent onely to auoid or remooue them, and neuer to bring any glorie to him. Which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth many men who hope of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to take libertie to ſinne, when once they are freed. As <hi>Ahab</hi> did, who when he was puniſhed, thought he had diſpleaſed God, and ſo ſought to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:6506:95"/> pleaſe him againe by his outward hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, that hee might eſcape the puniſhment, but neuer thought of the diſhonour hee had done to God, but returned to his old ſinnes againe. Men commonly doe but humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as mariners doe, who in a ſtorme and in the danger of ſhipwracke make long prayers and large promiſes vnto God; but if they haue once eſcaped to the land, and recouered their ſpirits, they returne to their old diſtempers and diſorders again: ſo many men who are crept out of a iudgement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe to their old diſhonoring of God; which proueth plainly that in their repentance they onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected themſelues, and not the glorie of God at all, or at leaſt not principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they ſhould.</p>

               </note> I muſt yet proſecute it further, and in the next place ſpeake of the parties in whom this true repentance is wrought. For as the Apoſtle ſaith, that all haue not faith, ſo repentance is not common to all, that is to ſay, true, ſincere, and ſauing repentance; for there is a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Ethnicks and Infidels, who for feare of puniſhment, and ſometime for loue of vertue, may leaue their ſinnes. And there is a ſerious repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the wicked, but it is but temporarie, as that of <hi>Ahab,</hi> which is but worldly ſorrow that brings forth death. And there is a repentance of hypocrites, which is fained and Phariſaicall, onely in the outward act. But of none of theſe doe I ſpeake, but of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſuch as is deſcribed before; tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which this is the point to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued:</p>

               </note> That true, ſincere, and ſauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is onlie of the elect; and that none can repent, and truely turne to

               <hi>God hath made him a Prince and a Sauiour to giue repentance to Iſrael.</hi> That is, to the true people of God. Hence it is that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romanes <note place="margin">Rom. 2.5.</note> ſpeaketh of ſome <hi>that cannot repent through the hardnes of their hearts.</hi> Likewiſe the Author to the Hebrewes excludeth manie from repentance, and ſaith, <note place="margin">Heb. 6.4.</note>

Therefore let no man deſpaire in himſelfe though hee haue fallen, and that often, but that yet hee may be renewed againe by repentance, for the couenant of God is generall and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:6506:109"/> perpetuall: generall, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinnes, and perpetuall, without limitation of time; for great ſinnes as well as for ſmall, and for all ſinnes as well as any, and for all times as well as once. To what end elſe was that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated of God? <note place="margin">Exod. 34.6.7.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord, the Lord, ſtrong, mercifull and grations, ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and abundant in goodnes and truth, reſeruing mercy for thouſands, forgiuing iniquitie, tranſgreſſion and ſins:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the ſpirit of God thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate <hi>iniquitie, tranſgreſſion, and ſinne,</hi> if it were ſo, that a man falling after his calling, were not to be renewed by repentance? and where were the gratious goodnes of God? But admit the ground of this temptation were true; yet is it as certaine a truth, that a man falling into ſeuerall ſinnes after his repentance, may riſe againe and be pardoned; and though one ſinne again willingly, yet alſo be pardoned: why not then falling into one and the ſame? Nay if <hi>Peter</hi> fell three times together into one ſinne for the kind of it, but euery time differing in the quantitie of it, yea and the laſt the greateſt, and after all this yet found mercy: why may not a man, though he fall againe into the ſame ſinne yet find

It may be wich Princes a barre, in their proceedings; if they haue pardoned a man for a great offence, why they ſhould not grant him a pardon for the ſame, nay not for a leſſe. But with God it will be no barre at all: for he being infinitely more mercifull then men, and yet requiring this of men: <note place="margin">Luke 17.4.</note>

By all this I giue not libertie to ſinne, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any man to tranſgreſſe; I onely comfort them who haue ſinned. That ſeeing repentance is appointed for the regenerate, as well as for the vnregenerate, to renew thoſe that are fallen, as well as to renew thoſe who were neuer yet called; they ſhould not doubt but to find mercie whenſoeuer they ſought the Lord, if ſo be they ſought him in truth.</p>

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:6506:110"/> there a neceſſarie vſe of the preaching of the word, as well to men that are called, as to them that are not. This muſt bee vnto them inſtead of Chriſts looke vpon <hi>Peter,</hi>

The end of preaching was not only to beget men, but to vphold men alſo and renew them after their ſlippes and falles. For he that is in the beſt eſtate in this life is but as a ſhip, which if it be neglected it will rot in the hauen, and if it bee kept neuer ſo carefully, it will ſtill need ſome repairing. So euery man in this condition, if he be negligent, he will ſoone be corrupted; and be he as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as hee can, hee ſhall neede ſome repairing: for liuing in a corrupt age, and in the company of wicked men, hee cannot chuſe but gather corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: how then ſhall hee bee renewed? muſt it not be by repentance? But how ſhall he repent, and be ſtirred vp to this dutie, though he were as perfect as <hi>Peter,</hi> if he haue not the looke of Chriſt and the crow of the cocke? I ſpeake this in reſpect of thoſe who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the preaching of the word after the Church is gathered, not ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie,

               </note> The ſecond ſigne or effect thereof, is in our tranſlation called, clearing of our ſelues: <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.2.</note> 
               <hi>yea what clearing of your ſelues. Ambroſe</hi> readeth it, as if it were, confeſſion, whereas ſome reade it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing; for repentance hath no excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing but confeſſion, ſaith one. The word is <hi>Apologie</hi> or defence. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not, that a penitent man, for the auoyding of God iudgements, ſhould either deny the offence, or leſſen his fault, which cannot ſtand with true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. But the defence here ſpoken of, is a defence againſt ſinne and Satan accuſing him; when as one by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation, and deſire of the pardon of his ſinne, (accuſing himſelfe to God, and ſo deſiring pardon) hath obtained it, by which hee may bee able to make his defence againſt ſinne and Satan; and this I take to bee the meaning of the word: whereupon I ground this:</p>

                  <hi>Cleering of our ſelues, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the ſecond ſigne or effect of repentance.</hi>
               </note> That ſorrow according to God, and true repentance, bringeth foorth in the repentant a clearing of himſelfe, and a defence by deprecation. That is to ſay, when a man hath the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſinne, and findeth it, and Satan
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:6506:117"/> accuſing of him, he cannot abide and beare that accuſation, but is diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vntill he haue gotten the pardon of his ſinne, therfore he flieth to God, and prayeth to him for the forgiuenes of his ſinne, with as much feruencie and earneſtnes, as for the weightieſt thing in the world, confeſſing the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and inditement, but deſiring the pardon of it, by which hee may bee able to anſwere his accuſers. So ſaith the Apoſtle there, the defence which he ſpeaketh of being againſt theſe, and that which defendeth him, being to be had from God. Thus <hi>Hoſea</hi> taught the people, by deprecation and prayer to get that where with they might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere their enemie, when hee bad them pray the Lord <hi>to take away all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hoſea 14.2.</note> that being pardoned they might defend themſelues againſt the accuſation of ſinne and Satan. This was alſo the practiſe of <hi>Daniel,</hi> firſt to confeſſe his ſinnes and accuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to God, and then he ſaid, <note place="margin">Dan. 9.18.19.</note> 
               <hi>O Lord heare, O Lord forgiue,</hi> &amp;c. Likewiſe <hi>Dauid</hi> commeth and intreateth God for pardon of his ſinnes, as a fruit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repentance.

So the prodigall ſon, being long in a vaine courſe, when his conſcience began to accuſe him, and his ſinnes were brought to mind by his ſorrowes, and penurie he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; hee came to his father in cloſe words, deſiring the pardon of his fact, by way of accuſing of himſelf, ſaying, <note place="margin">Luke 15.18.19.</note>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6506:118"/> but contrarily haue gone about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their ſins, either by denying it, or putting God to his proofes, as they did deale with him in <hi>Malachie:</hi>

               <hi>Wherein haue wee deſpiſed thy name? wherein haue we polluted thee?</hi> Or by defence, as <hi>Ionah</hi> did, who when God asked him if he did well to be angrie, anſwered, <note place="margin">Ionah 4.</note> that <hi>he did well to be angrie euen to the death.</hi> Or by a cautelous anſwere, as <hi>Cain</hi> did, who when God asked him where his brother was, hee anſwered: <note place="margin">Geneſ. 6.9.</note>

Or if none of theſe will ſerue, then is that of the Elephant wel moralized in them, and as it were veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: for he being guiltie of his defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, cannot abide to looke his owne face in the cleere water, but flies it, and ſeekes the muddy and troubled cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels: ſo they know their ſoules are ſo filthie, that they dare not ſo much as
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:6506:119"/> to come where they ſhall be made to ſee themſelues, but deſire that which will dawbe them vp. But if all will not ſerue, but that they are againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine made to ſee their ſins, and their conſcience is awakned to accuſe them, either by the word or by ſome afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vexing them as the euill ſpirit did <hi>Saul;</hi> then they ſeeke to diſpatch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſuch thoughts, by muſike, and mirth, paſtime, and dalliance, as <hi>Saul</hi> did the euill ſpirit by <hi>Dauids</hi> playing vpon a harpe; and ſo increaſe them more and more, and cauſe them to ranckle inwardly. Theſe are like deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who being cleane out at heeles: as wee ſay, ſeeke ſhifts to put off the clamor of their creditors for a day or a week, and ſeeke no protection for themſelues, no way to cleere them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: but when they know their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors haue entred actions againſt them, and feed Sergeants to arreſt them; yea when they are arreſted, they onely ſeeke to corrupt the Sergeants, or get them into a Tauerne and make them drunke, and ſo get from them, and then they thinke all is well: So theſe being farre in debt, and arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by an accuſing conſcience, all their care is how to bee eaſed of it,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:6506:119"/> how to corrupt it, or to make it drunke with pleaſures and delites; and then they thinke all will be well. But in the meane time all is worſe then naught with them, for they are without true repentance, which hath not a defence of ſinne, but an accuſation of ſinne, and takes a courſe to cleere the perſon, and to get a defence and protection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all accuſations and accuſers.</p>

                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> 1. That many men perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and are deceiued by their owne harts, thinking that they haue truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, when the time is yet to come that euer they were angrie and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with themſelues, for the ſin they had committed; or diſliked and hated their ſin. Nay many, &amp; moſt liue ſtill in their ſins, and loue them, becauſe they bring them in, pleaſure, honor, gaine, &amp;c. As ſome Courts haue liked of, and hountenanced Informers, becauſe they bring ſacks to the mill; and as the Pope doth the ſtewes, becauſe of the reuenew hee receiues thereby; ſo they like of their ſinnes, becauſe of that good which commeth of them, as they account good, and therefore they will not leaue them, neither can they diſlike or hate them. Yea often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are gauled or grieued for them by ſome reproofe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or by the word, by ſome afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or iudgement, as beggers euer &amp; anon are by their ſores: yet as they will not haue thoſe ſores cured, becauſe they are a couer for eaſe and idlenes, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:6506:123"/> now and then bring them in a peny; and therefore cannot endure the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geans but if they be forced to receiue ſome plaiſter, they will pull it off ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie againe, when his backe is once turned: ſo is it with theſe men in their ſins, they diſlike them not, they would not be cured of them, nay they diſlike them, who would helpe to pull them out of them. And therefore as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> cried out againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts. 19.25.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his crafts-mates, becauſe hee would ouerthrow their craft, by which they got their goods; ſo doe theſe men againſt all them, which would ouerthrow their trade and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of ſinning. And if this be a ſigne of true repentance, and an vnſeparable fruite, ſuch men deceiue themſelues if they think they haue repented. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, ſome men there be that can leaue their ſinnes, who yet neuer did, nor do lothe them, or were angry with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for them; but therefore only left them, either becauſe they found loſſe and damage by them; as the young man his ioy and prodigalitie, when he groweth in yeeres or becauſe ſtrength of bodie and abilitie faileth them, as the adulterer his follie; or becauſe they haue felt the ſmart of them, as
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6506:123"/> when the hand of God, or the ſword of the Magiſtrate hath met with them. But that theſe neuer diſliked their ſinnes is manifeſt, for they haue but changed prodigalitie for couetouſnes, which argueth no true diſlike of ſin, or indignation: for that is as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt loue, as another, and if againſt any, thou againſt all: whereupon theſe men when they haue ſtrength, returne to the ſtewes againe, and when the hand of God is once remooued from them, to their former ſinnes. They were offended with this, not with their ſinnes, and therefore neuer tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie repented. To theſe wee may adde alſo all ſuch, as talke of the ſinnes and infirmities of their youth with ioy, or without indignation, ſo ſhewing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly that they haue left them, but not repented of them.</p>

            <p>There is a double feare, one filiall, and an other fertile, differing thus; 1. In reſpect of the obiect, which is ſin: Filiall feare feareth ſinne as ſinne, and becauſe it is ſin: ſeruile feare feareth puniſhment rather then ſin, and ſin in reſpect of puniſhment. 2. In reſpect of their grounds, for filiall feare fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God, becauſe he is gracious and merciful: feruile feare feareth God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is luſt, and powerfull, and able to putriſh for ſinne. 3. They dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in regard of their attendance, for fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall feare is ioyned with loue, ſuch as good ſubiects beare to good Princes, and ordinarily children beare to their parents: but ſeruile feare is ioyued with hatred, ſuch, as ſeruants beare to their cruol inaſters: this maketh a man flee from God and get as farre as hee can out of his ſight: the other maketh a man draw neerer and neerer to God, and preſſe vpon him as farre as hee can with reuerence.

Becauſe the repentant hath a perſwaſion of the loue of God to him; which hee knoweth from his owne loue to God, which he findeth in himſelfe (this riſing as it were from the reflexe of that heate) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will flie to GOD, and not from him, euen when hee hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him.</p>
            <p>Now vpon this thus taught and proued, I ground theſe vſes, croſſing ſome, and comforting others.</p>
            <p>1. This is a hard ſaying for many, in whom there is no feare, or at leaſt but a ſlauiſh and ſeruile feare, which is manifeſt thus, becauſe they hate ſinne onely for the puniſhment; that is, they like and loue their ſinne
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:6506:127"/> indeed, but ſometime reſtraine the committing of it, in regard of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that may inſue of it: as he that hath a mind to eate ſome kind of meate, that the Phyſition hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den him, and is hurtfull, abſtaineth only, becauſe he dareth not touch it for feare of further inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences. Or then onely they abſtaine from it when they feele his hand, or feare an immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent iudgement, or haue the freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſome one which is new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remoued. Or onely for feare of the euill, or hope of good. The whippe, ſcourge, and rod cauſeth the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite as an aſſe, a foole, and a ſlaue, to forbeare, and leaue ſinne. And the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges only makes the hireling to doe ſo. Againe, becauſe their feare is ioyned with hatred, ſuch as ſeruants haue to their bad and cruell maſters, and therefore they would get themſelues from God, as fugitiue ſeruants. Like vnto <hi>Hagar,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 16.</note> that was inforced to flie from her cruell miſtres. Therefore ſaith one, the wicked are troubled after ſinne, that they cannot get themſelues farre enough from God; as the godly are on the contrarie diſtracted after their offences, that they cannot come neere enough to God; thoſe being
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:6506:127"/> afraid to be found of God, as theſe to loſe God. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> compareth the wicked to an vnchaſt and an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous woman, who feareth her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but it is becauſe ſhee loueth her naughtines, therefore his companie is not delightfull but burthenſome, and liuing ill, ſhe is affraid of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, leſt hee finde her, and finde out her naughtines, and lightnes. Laſtly, becauſe their feare is ioyned with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of God, and ſo, as, <note place="margin">

               </note> whom <hi>me feare they hate, and whom they hate they deſire might periſh:</hi> So they feare and hate God, and could deſire he were not. And ſuch a man is not only an homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, but a deicide, wiſhing there were neuer a God to puniſh him; or at leaſt, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deum ſua pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata vindicare, aut non poſſe, aut nolle, aut ea neſcire: &amp; ſic vult Deum non eſſe Deum, qui vult Deum aut iniuſtum, aut impotentem, aut inſipientem eſſe. Bern.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>God either could not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his ſinnes or would not, or did not know them.

And ſo cannot otherwiſe, without lying to his owne ſoule, perſwade himſelfe, but that he wanteth true repentance, whoſe fruite is a filiall feare.</p>
            <p>2. This is for comfort, where this filiall feare is, and to them who haue
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:6506:128"/> it, for they by it may be aſſured they haue the true godly ſorrow. Now this is to be diſcerned by the contraries of ſeruile feare; becauſe they who haue this filiall feare doe hate ſinne becauſe it is ſinne, and would not commit it though it might bee done without danger, as a man that loatheth any meate, will not cate it, though the Phyſitians aſſure him hee may doe it without ſurfit, becauſe hee hath a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and diſlike of it. Againe, they diſlike not the outward act, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall worke only, but alſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, motions, and affections tending thereto: they hate them though they cannot auoid them. It grieueth them to offend, yea to bee prouoked to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, ſo good and gratious, ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and louing a father, who hath euer been ſo good and gracious vnto them. Their feare is euer ioyned with loue, ſuch as good ſubiects beare to good princes and children to their fathers, and therefore they ſeeke to preſſe as neere to God as they can, &amp; dare with reuerence of his maieſtie, (like the prodigall ſonne, who came to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and willingly yeelded himſelf into his hands) being troubled that by reaſon of their ſin they cannot
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:6506:128"/> come neere enough to God, fearing to loſe God. Wherefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> compareth theſe to a chaſt woman, who loueth and feareth her husband, and liueth with him in good ſort, and would neuer haue him out of her ſight, yea ſhe ſo loueth him, that ſhee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to offend him becauſe hee is her husband, ſhe feareth to giue him any occaſion to grieue, or to make him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from her: So where there is this true filial feare of the children of God, there is all carefull auoyding of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, there is all watchfulneſſe vſed, that no cauſe be giuen of grieuing him, or to make him depart; there is al deſire to inioy his preſence conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. Which things whoſoeuer true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly findeth in himſelfe, hee may know himſelfe to haue this fourth effect of true repentance, yea to haue repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it ſelfe, and ſo to be in the ſtate of ſaluation.</p>

               <hi>I beare them witnes that they haue the zeale of God, but not according to knowledge:</hi> that is, their zeale was not ruled by reaſon, nor grounded vpon the word of God, but according to their owne fancie: tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs thereby what is good, and what is bad zeale. Zeale is then euill and bad when it will not be, nor is ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by true knowledge (that is, not ſubiect to the word) but by cuſtome, tradition, our own affections and wils; and of this may be ſaid, as before, <note place="margin">Rom. 10.2.</note> that ſuch haue zeale, but not according to knowledge: and they may be prayed for, as Chriſt prayed for the Iewes: <note place="margin">Luke 23.34.</note> 
               <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgiue them, for they know not what they doe.</hi> And this zeale argueth no repentance: but that which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to knowledge, ſubmitted to the word of God, is good, and wil prooue a man to haue repentance. Againe, zeale conſiſteth of two affections, loue and ſorrow; loue for the glorie of God and his ſeruice; ſorrow when it is not performed. May wee compare ſpirituall things with earthly things? whereſoeuer there is this loue it is ſpeedie for the compaſſing of that it deſireth. Therefore wee reade when <hi>Shechim</hi> loued <hi>Dinah, Iacobs</hi> daughter, <note place="margin">Geneſ. 34.19.</note>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:6506:137"/> he was ſpeedie in compaſſing that, by which he might obtaine her, though the thing was very ſore and grieuous which he was to doe: ſo where there is this affection in the heart of man, it maketh a man forward, and ſpeedie to procure the glorie of God, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his ſeruice. Secondly, loue hath another propertie; whereſoeuer it is, notwithſtanding all difficulties, diſcouragements, or dangers, yet will that man goe forward for the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that hee loueth, and dreadeth not for any feare or diſcouragement, ſo he may obtaine the thing hee affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth. So it is ſaid of <hi>Iacob,</hi> he ſerued ſeuen yeeres for <hi>Rachel,</hi> and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by her father, in giuing vnto him <hi>Leah</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Rachel,</hi> hee was content to ſerue ſeuen yeeres more, <note place="margin">Gen. 29 20.</note> and yet thoſe yeeres ſeemed vnto him but a few daies, hauing borne the cold of the winter, the heate of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the chilling of the Moone, and the burning of the Sunne, the dangers both by night and day; and all this was becauſe he loued her. So if there be this loue of God in men, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhrinke for all difficulties that may be; he that hath it, will not faint, nor be hindred with all lets and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:6506:138"/> which may fall out, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches and indignities which men, Satans complices, wil be readie to caſt vpon him; neither will he thinke the time long, nor the labour too much for it, but goe thorow, and thorow trauell and paine, that he may procure the glorie of God, and aduance his worſhip and ſeruice. Therfore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as men pretend zeale, let them exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelues according to this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and trie whether there bee this loue in the heart or not. Thirdly, he that hath true zeale, he hath this affection of ſorrow, mourning when he cannot obtaine, or procure the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God as he would. We haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to compare heauenly things with earthly, and ſpiritual with carnal, may we once more proceed? It is written of <hi>Ammon</hi> that when he could not inioy <hi>Tamar,</hi> whom hee loued, <note place="margin">2. Sam. 13.2.4.</note> 
               <hi>hee was ſore vexed and fell ſicke, and grew leane day by day,</hi> becauſe hee could not enioy her; theſe effects had his loue in him. So when there is true loue to God and his glorie, there if men cannot further it, as much as they would, if they cannot enioy his word, if they ſee him diſhonoured, and falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip eſtabliſhed, they will pine and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:6506:138"/> grieue and fall away. As it is ſaid, <note place="margin">Pſalm. 69.9.</note> 
               <hi>The zeale of thy houſe hath eaten mee.</hi> And as <hi>Elias</hi> ſaid, <note place="margin">1. King. 19.10.</note> 
               <hi>I haue been very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Hee was ſo ſtricken with ſorrow, that he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to die, becauſe he ſaw not the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God go forward: ſo that where there is true zeale, there is alſo this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſorrow and mourning. Then let euery man examine himſelfe, by theſe three rules, whether he haue this affection within him or no, and ſo whether he haue repented: if he haue not this affection, at the beſt he is but lukewarme, and euen ſuch an one whom God wil ſpue out of his mouth, and caſt out of his houſe: but hauing it truly in himſelfe, he may be aſſured he hath truly repented, and ſo is rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and holy, and ſhall both abide in the houſe of God all his life, and be afterwards receiued into his euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting tabernacles.</p>

This being then a ſigne, or fruit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it muſt begin, and bee in a mans ſelfe. It differs from indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe that is in the affection, this is in the action: that is a iuſt conceiued anger towards himſelfe for his ſinne, and hatred of the ſinne; this the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of himſelfe for thoſe ſinnes, and a taking as it were, a iuſtreuenge of himſelfe for them.

Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> repenting, <note place="margin">2.

Likewiſe another example in the ſame man may be ſeene, when in giuing way vnto his luſt, <note place="margin">1. Chron. 11.18.19.</note> he had deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the waters of Bethlehem, and after did ſee it was brought with the liues of his three Worthies: to take a holie reuenge of himſelfe, hee would not drinke of it, but powred it vpon the ground, for a ſacrifice to the Lord. Likewiſe, we haue the example of the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:6506:140"/> woman, <note place="margin">Luke 7.38.</note> that ſhewed the fruit of her repentance, hauing before abuſed her eies to vncleannes, and her haire to vanitie, by laying it out to the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of youth to follie, when ſhe had repented ſhe tooke a holy reuenge of her ſelfe, and vſed her eies as a ſpring to yeeld water to waſh Chriſts feete, and her haire to be as a towell to wipe them.

            <p>Now the difficultie appeareth: 1. Becauſe cuſtome is another nature, and as hard it is for a man to change, that hee is accuſtomed to, as to alter natures courſe. Hence is that of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:</hi>

Nay, nature itſelfe if it haue any ſparke of the image of God remaining, teacheth otherwiſe. If a man haue a father, or but a friend, that by reaſon of the loue he beareth him, would hardly be diſpleaſed, or moued to anger againſt him, would he make this vſe of his loue, and patience, ſtill to prouoke him with new iniutles? Nay
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:6506:170"/> it would moue him to loue him, and loue would make him loth to diſpleaſe him, and fearfull to offend him. Which being ſo, then theſe men are monſters in nature, and reaſon, that becauſe God will be mercifull, therefore they will ſinne, and diſpleaſe him. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine vs from this preſumption, wee muſt remember what is prooued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that God is iuſt, as well as merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and that the promiſes of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the repentant, and not to the obſtinate; and though God be good to his, yet that he will deſtroy the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: and let vs not anſwere God with theſe vnkindneſſes, becauſe he is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, therefore we will ſinne againſt him; but rather becauſe he is gratious, let vs turne vnto him, and we ſhall find pardon.</p>

If any ſhall pretend vnto me the maintenance of his life, and bodie, in health, and competency, and prouiſion for his wife, and children: I denie not, but that men may lawfully, yea muſt of neceſſity haue care of their temporal eſtate, yea ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as it is worſe, and more vnſetled: For if the bodie periſh for want of things needfull, how ſhould the foule bee indued with the life of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe?

And as for theſe who haue theſe outward things alreadie, <note place="margin">Luke 10.41.</note> they may more freely ſeeke the ſpirituall, and are bound more ſtrongly ſo to doe, and they ſhould know more is required of them.

For example, let a man caſt vpon thee very ſtrange and vnheard of infamies and reproches: if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride them, if thou ſet light by his words, thou haſt ſuffered no reproch. For as if thou hadſt a bodie of Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, or iron; if thou were ſmitten with innumerable darts on all ſides, yet thou hadſt, receiued neuer a wound: for wounds come not from the hands of him that caſt thoſe darts, but from the bodie of him that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: So here iniuries and reproches haue not their being from the madnes of him that reprocheth, but from the meekenes of him that ſuffereth.

               <hi>Al things come alike to al, and the ſame condition is to the iuſt, and to the wicked, to the good, and to the pure, and to the polluted, and to him that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not: as is the good, ſo is the ſinner, he that ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, as he that feareth an oth.</hi> And theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ends if they would conſider them well, ſhould make them rather haſten, then deferre repentance, doe it when they haue the vſe of their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, memorie, and other partes fit for ſuch a holy buſines; leſt deferring it, ſuch a diſtractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them at their ends, ſpecially ſeeing they ſee it hath happened to ſuch as are his. But they take with the left hand, that God offereth with the right hand, &amp; ſo turne it to their hurt.

               </gap>y, as they liued wickedly? Would not that malefactor bee condemned, who had meanes, opportunitie, and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:6506:185"/> time enough, to get his pardon, if he ſhould deferre vpon hope, that when hee was going to the gallowes hee might then haue his pardon, only vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, becauſe there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of one, that the King did ſo ſaue, and yet but one preſident of all the records of the land? So in this: were he not a deſperate fellow, that would vndertake to make an aſſe to ſpeake, and that vpon the hazard of his life, if he did it not, and preſuming to doe it, becauſe hee readeth of one Aſſe, <hi>Baalams</hi> Aſſe, which did ſpeake? <note place="margin">
                  <hi>August.</hi>
               </note> So here, there is one, that no man fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding true faith, and repentance ſhould deſpare; and but one, that none might preſume. Furthermore the act was a very extraordinarie thing, done at an extraordinarie time, at the laſt houre vpon the croſſe, when Chriſt was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring his glorie. And as Princes, at the time of their coronation, pardon ſuch notorious offenders, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the like whereof they will very hardly euer remit afterwards: So our Sauiour putting off his abaſement, and humiliation, and readie to enter his glory, and kingdome, did this to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his mercie, virtue, and excellency of his merit, which he then performed
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:6506:185"/> vpon the croſſe. The occaſion extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie; the action not like to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie. Now what follie were it, for a man to commit ſuch a grieuous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, vpon hope before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day of Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coronatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Prince may come? and more follie and madnes is there in this.

               </note> which will put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of theſe men from the theefe. As firſt, he did not wittinglie, but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly deferre his repentance, hauing not had the doctrine of the Goſpel, by which he might be brought to come to Chriſt, and repent: but they haue liued a long time within the ſound of it, and haue neglected, and contemned it. The ſecond difference which <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> putteth betweene theſe impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, and the theefe, is, that hee did not deſperately reſerue the hope of his redemption to the laſt houre; but theſe moſt vngratefully reſolue ſo to doe, and therefore deſerue reiection. 3. He had no knowledge, either of religion, or of Chriſt before this time, for if hee had had, it may be he would not haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:6506:186"/> ignorance be affected, and by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence brought vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themſelues. 4. His beleefe and confeſſion was ſhort, but it was moſt vnfained and deuout; the occaſion ſheweth it, becauſe it was then, when the perfection of the iuſt did ſtagger, ſaith <hi>Augustine,</hi> his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for feare forſooke him, and his Apoſtles doubted of him; yea we may adde, that though the people railed on him, yet hee prayed to him, and when his fellow theefe reuiled him, hee iuſtified him, confeſſed his owne ſinnes, and louinglie admoniſhed his fellow, deſiring as they had been brethren in iniquitie, they might bee partners in the pardon of it, and in the worke of redemption. But theirs moſt commonlie is not for loue of God, but feare of hell, not for hatred of ſin, but the puniſhment, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie diſſembled, and hypocriticall. Seeing how vſually then they thus differ from the theefe, why doe they hope of his end? Shew me that faith of the theefe in thy ſelfe, (ſaith <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>) and then promiſe to thy ſelfe the like felicitie. But when as faith, and repentance, is the free gift of God, which he ſeldom beſtoweth on thoſe, who haue contemned them in their
